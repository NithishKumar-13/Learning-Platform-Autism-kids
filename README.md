# Learning Platform Autism kids
This is an educational website I developed during my first semester, specifically designed to support children with autism in their learning journey. While the platform is still in its early stages and not yet a complete website, it currently includes a few interactive modules designed to engage and educate:
- Understanding Human Emotions through gifs
- Learning Country location in the world map by clicking on Country flag
- A simple youtube video explaining "What are Continents and Countries"
- Learning fruits and their pronounciation through visuals and audio

## Contributions Welcome
This is an early-stage project, and Iâ€™d love to see it grow with community input!
